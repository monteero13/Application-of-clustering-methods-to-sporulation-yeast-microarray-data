# Describe the datasets are included.

**Table 1** in the paper shows dissimilarities between twelve countries, calculated by averaging the results of a survey conducted among political science students. These dissimilarities represent how students perceive differences between countries based on a set of criteria, likely related to political, cultural, or social characteristics.

- **Entities:** The twelve countries surveyed.

- **Dissimilarity Metric:** The dissimilarity between any pair of countries is calculated based on student responses. These could be subjective perceptions of how different the countries are in various aspects (such as governance, international relations, or political systems).

- **Data Type:** The table contains numeric values indicating the dissimilarity between country pairs, which are used in clustering analysis.

The purpose of this dissimilarity matrix is to apply clustering techniques to group countries based on their perceived similarity, which can then be evaluated using the silhouette index to determine the quality of these groupings. The silhouette index helps assess whether the clustering correctly reflects the underlying perception data from the survey.

**Ruspini Dataset** contains 75 points in a two-dimensional space (with two variables), distributed into four distinct groups. It was introduced by Enrico Ruspini in 1970 and is widely used as an educational example for demonstrating and validating clustering algorithms.

- **Variables:** The dataset consists of two coordinates representing points in a plane. These points correspond to observations that need to be grouped into clusters.

- **Clustering Objective:** The goal is to classify the 75 points into the four natural clusters they belong to, based on their proximity in the two-dimensional space.

- **Use of the Silhouette Index:** The silhouette index is used to evaluate how well-separated the points are within the four clusters and how compact the formed groups are.

The Ruspini dataset is a great demonstration of how the silhouette index can be applied to assess the quality of clustering in a simple geometric space.

**The silhouette index** measures how similar an object is to its own cluster (cohesion) compared to other clusters (separation). In every example, the following insights can be derived from calculating the silhouette index:

## Value Range

- The silhouette index ranges between -1 and +1.

- A value near +1 suggests that the sample is well clustered, as it is far from neighboring clusters.

- A value near 0 implies that the sample is on or very close to the decision boundary between two clusters.

- Negative values suggest that the sample might be in the wrong cluster.

## Cluster Quality

- High average silhouette width (closer to +1) indicates that the clusters are well-separated and well-formed.

- Lower or negative values indicate poor clustering, where some points may be incorrectly assigned to clusters.

## Visual Aid

- The silhouette plot gives a visual insight into the number of clusters, revealing how many well-separated and distinct clusters exist within the dataset.

Thus, in each example, by calculating and interpreting the silhouette index, you can deduce the overall clustering structure, helping identify strong and weak clusters, and assess the validity of the chosen clustering method or parameters.
